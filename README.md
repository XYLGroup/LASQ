# 🧠 LASQ: Unsupervised Hierarchical Learning for Illumination Enhancement

---

## 🏗️ 1. Introduction

LASQ reformulates low-light image enhancement as a statistical sampling process over hierarchical luminance distributions, leveraging a diffusion-based forward process to autonomously model luminance transitions and achieve unsupervised, generalizable light restoration across diverse illumination conditions.
The overall architecture is illustrated below 👇
